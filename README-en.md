# Ask @williamcanin anything!

This is a small, quick "**ask me anything**" repository.
The interesting thing is to ask questions about programming and technological culture. If you have any technical problems with projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/williamcanin), I recommend making a *Issue* in the project's own repository. If you want to participate in any project [my](https://github.com/williamcanin) here on GitHub, you can open an *Issue* here for contact.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as creating an "*issue*" in a project.

I will try to answer as soon as I can. Once I answer, I will close the problem just to be in control of it, but don't worry, if you have any more questions, answer the topic and I will get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question about any idea. We can exchange knowledge!

### Read some questions

Check the filter [Issue Closed](https://github.com/williamcanin/askme/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) in this repository to browse the questions I answered. Use the filter too, to try to find a question you already have in mind, so you can avoid duplicate questions. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, and minimize the maximum number of duplicate questions for me.


### Personal page

You can browse my [personal page](http://williamcanin.github.io) (in Portuguese) and find some information to have a broad view of subjects dominated by me, and thus carry out the question at the same level.
